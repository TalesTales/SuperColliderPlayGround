// HW7

// This assignment is meant to guide you into a more freeform creative workflow with SuperCollider. Using techniques for real-time pattern control demonstrated in class (Pdefn, Pdef, Pbindef), code and perform a short "Ã©tude", at least one minute long (longer is ok). Use at least one SynthDef with a sufficient number of controllable arguments, and your composition should also involve at least two sound-producing patterns, which play simultaneously at some point in the composition. Feel free to "rehearse" as much as you like, but sometimes the most interesting things happen spontaneously. Above all, try to make it sound musical and interesting!

// Submission format is flexible. Options include:

// (1) make a real-time audio/video recording using screen capture software, upload your code as-is, and also upload (or link to) your video recording, OR

// (2) using the record feature on the server interface produced by evaluating s.makeGui, create an audio-only recording, and submit the recording along with your code, as-is, OR

// (3) write out all of your performance code in a step-by-step manner, so that I can perform your composition on my own (add comments as appropriate), and submit only your code file, OR

// (4) something else? Check with me if you're unsure.

// You'll be graded primarily on demonstrated effort, but also on musicality and adherence to the assignment guidelines. A good solid attempt that showcases some engaging musical ideas will receive full credit. As usual, save your work with your last name at the beginning of your file names, be sure to include audio files and write your buffer-related code correctly (if relevant), and upload your files to the course website when you're ready to submit.
